# personal-blog-system
A Simple personal daily blog for keep tracking of  daily things.

### Step 1
Clone the repo and run to install all the node modules
``` npm install```

### Issue
When creating a new post at ```http(s)://host:port/compose``` page doesn't redirect instead it keeps loading slowly. I'll fix that later :) If you can fix it then fork it and send pull request.
